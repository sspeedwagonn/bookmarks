# Bookmarks
This is a collection of resources I have come across that I want to reference back to in the future, AKA my bookmarks. This repository covers many topics and forms of media and is not programming-centric. Contributions are welcome - this repository will be kept public for anyone else like me who enjoys cool (and free!) stuff. (:
